Does anyone have/know_of any papers on the design of algorithms/programs
to play go?  Any help would be much appreciated.  (I've decided to
try my hand at writing a program to play go ...)

This may be of general interest:

D. B. Benson.
        Life in the game of go.
        Information Sciences 10, 17-29 (1976).

M. Tackett.
        A pattern recognition approach to tesuji programming in go.
        Washington State University, Pullman, Washington.
        (technical report?)
        This paper has three references to Proceedings of ACM-CIPS
        Pacific Northwest Symposium (June 1976) to papers by D.B. Benson and
        J.D. Starkey (last reference), M. Tackett, and P. Evers.

J. Miller.
        The end game of go. also from WSU.
        
D. B. Benson & J. D. Starkey
        The game of go on the computer.

These people were (are?) all at Washington State University, Pullman.
In the abstract of the Benson & Starkey paper they say "At WSU we have
begun a long term project to play ... Go on the computer". I didn't
follow the work - does anyone know if the project is still going on or
what has happened to it?
