Improved Territory Analysis
	consider how containiment functions can be employed in program
	implement tentative and actual containment functions

Eye Analysis
	research whether or not other people keep track of regions of
	free space the same way they keep track of strings of stones

Openings
	reread opening metaphysics in the beginning and consider how
	it might be implemented

Joseki
	read over some basic joseki
	design encoding for joseki positions and algorithm for doing it
	design routines to turn move histories into joseki records
	consider functions to display joseki dictionary
	design joseki interpreter
	build basic joseki dictionary
	figure out how to recognize when it is time to invoke joseki

Eye-shape analysis
	extend joseki dictionary for eye-shape and life/death tactics
	design killer/saver
	consider other generalizations to this concept

Move evaluation
	design human aided tactical analyzer, where user picks moves
	to consider and designates those to consider more deeply

	design human interface to move evaluator

Move generation
	figure out how to represent tactical goals - since we should
	always have an objective basis for move evaluation.

	consider design of one or more move generators and framework
	into which multiple move generators could fit

real play
	consider how to keep around some of our tentative analysis
	so that we can go much more quickly when the opponent makes
	a move that we predicted - like maybe keep around several
	trees that looked best, to save us wear and tear on the
	move generator when things go as we expected - use the time
	to go deeper into what we predicted.

ladder analysis
	decide how to recognize when ladder analysis should be invoked
	decide how to build iterative ladder analysis
		is it necessary to really make the moves, or would it
		be sufficient to scan for stones along the path
	perhaps this is easily handled as a trivial case of a special
		"chase" move generator whose whole purpose is to try
		to keep someone bottled by maintaining atari's.  It 
		might well buy us no runs along the first row at the
		same time - using a more liberal definition of a ladder.
