simplified choice of game display mode to fix problems with monochrome
monitors on machines that claim to be better.  Now, if you come in in
monochrome mode, you play in monochrome mode.  The user can determine
the mode of play by using the "mode" command before starting the game.

fixed a bug in KO handling that was introduced in the massive rearchitecting.
Now, ko is no longer a global.  Each move has an associated ko position
(typically 0).  The KO check is always performed by comparing the proposed
move position with the KO position from the previous move.  This eliminates
the need to change the global variable after a play or undo, and the searches
to find where the KO position might be - at a cost of only a few hundred
bytes.

also fixed numerous erroneous comments in move.h and libs.c
