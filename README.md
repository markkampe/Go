# Go
Program to play the game of Go

I had always played Go (poorly), and when I was in grad-school (at UCLA in the mid-70s)
I decided it would be fun to implement a program to play that game.  I started out doing
it on V(1.)6 UNIX.  A few years later I decided to bring it back (in DOS so I could share
it with friends), but quickly lost interest in it.  Forty years later I was looking
through old back-ups (trying to find ancient UNIX projects to run on my V6 PiDP11/70),
and I stumbled on this.  I am not at all sure what my intentions are ... but whatever I
might want to do starts with putting it into Git :-)
